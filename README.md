# Introduction

"Ulin" Android Travel App, your guide to exploring the top 10 natural tourist destinations in Sukabumi. <br>
Designed with simplicity in mind, this app focuses on a core feature that enhances your travel experience. <br>
With just a tap on your chosen destination, you'll be seamlessly directed to Google Maps for navigation, thanks to its integration using implicit intents.<br>
Despite being lightweight in functionality, "Ulin" aims to provide an easy and direct way to discover and reach Sukabumi's stunning natural attractions.

Also this is my first Android App using Kotlin as the Native Programming Language of Android.

Thanks to Dicoding Indonesia as part of the Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka ! Because of this, I can learn about something new for me.
